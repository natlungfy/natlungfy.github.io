    <h1>Hello! I'm Natalie 龍馥瑜.</h1>
 <img src="images/IMG_8043.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>I am a technology reporter with Bloomberg News in New York. My passion for technology stems from a curiosity to understand how it affects our lives and how we can manage it for personal growth, entertainment and for social good. Whether it's gadgets, consumer apps or how people are using the newest Python libraries or AI models, I'm all ears. Read my <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATtc3tVaSDI/natalie-lung" target="_blank">latest work</a> on Bloomberg.com and let's <a href="mailto:flung6@bloomberg.net">chat</a>! You can also reach me via encrypted messaging on Signal @nlfy.15</p>
    <p>Previous roles in the newsroom included developing and conducting training on automation tools for the breaking news team in the US to cover the 2022 midterm elections and corporate earnings. Before relocating to NYC, I reported on breaking news in Hong Kong, where I was born and raised, drafting the first word on everything from the anti-government protests in 2019, the subsequent political fallout through 2020-21, Covid policies and indebted Chinese property developers. More clips <a href="http://natalielung.com/portfolio#writing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Outside of reporting and coding, you'll find me drumming away to disco funk music, reading memoirs, or raving about niche interest groups in the city.</p>
