    <h1>Hello! I'm Natalie 龍馥瑜.</h1>
 <img src="images/io.jpeg" width="100%">
    <p>
      I'm an HKU Journalism and Computer Science alumus exploring the intersection of media, data, and technology. I was an intern at the <a href="https://twitter.com/scmpgraphics" target="_blank">South China Morning Post Graphics Desk</a> and <a href="http://droste.hk" target="_blank">Droste</a>. I also led <a href="http://www.engineering.hku.hk/tecHKU/" target="_blank">TecHKU</a>, a technology news site at the university. In summer 2017, I was a visiting student with the <a href="https://civic.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Civic Media at the MIT Media Lab</a>, where I implemented Chinese-language support on <a href="https://mediacloud.org/" target="_blank">Media Cloud</a> and conducted research on Chinese-language media ecosystems.</p>

      My passion for technology stems from a curiosity to understand how it affects our lives and how we can manage it for personal entertainment and for social good.

      <p>Outside of reporting and coding, I love getting involved in tech, startup, and journalism communities.</p>

      <p>I am currently a reporter at Bloomberg News in Hong Kong, covering the Hong Kong and Chinese economies. Bylines <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATtc3tVaSDI/natalie-lung" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
