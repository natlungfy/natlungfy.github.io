    <h1>Hello! I'm Natalie 龍馥瑜.</h1>

    <p>I am a technology reporter with Bloomberg in New York. My passion for technology stems from a curiosity to understand how it affects our lives and how we can manage it for personal growth, entertainment and for social good. Whether it's gadgets, the coolest Python libraries or how people are interacting with the latest technology or social media, I'm all ears. Let's <a href="mailto:flung6@bloomberg.net">chat</a>!</p>
    <p>I was most recently an editor on the data-driven news team, improving and building editorial automation tools and streamlining news workflows to ensure speed, accuracy and depth of breaking news coverage in North America. Prior to that I reported on breaking news and politics in Hong Kong, where I was born and raised. Clips <a href="http://natalielung.com/portfolio#writing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Outside of reporting and coding, I love listening to music and podcasts, and getting involved in tech and journalism communities.</p>
