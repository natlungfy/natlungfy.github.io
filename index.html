    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>
      I'm an aspiring data/visual/investigative journalist studying at the University of Hong Kong. I have interned at <a href="https://twitter.com/scmpgraphics" target="_blank">South China Morning Post Graphics Desk</a> and <a href="droste.hk" target="_blank">Droste</a>. I also lead <a href="engineering.hku.hk/tecHKU/" target="_blank">TecHKU</a>, a technology news site at the university. 

      Outside of journalism, I love engaging in tech/startup communities. 

      I am currently on exchange at the University of Missouri.
