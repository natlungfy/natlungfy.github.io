    <h1>Hello! I'm Natalie 龍馥瑜.</h1>
 <img src="images/IMG_8043.jpg" width="100%">
    <p>I am currently an editor on the data-driven news team with Bloomberg in New York, devising editorial automation initiatives and streamlining news workflows to ensure speed, accuracy and depth of breaking news coverage in North America.</p>
    <p>Prior to that I reported on breaking news and politics in Hong Kong, where I was born and raised. Clips <a href="http://natalielung.com/portfolio#writing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>My passion for technology stems from a curiosity to understand how it affects our lives and how we can manage it for personal growth, entertainment and for social good.</p>
    <p>Outside of reporting and coding, I love listening to music and podcasts, and getting involved in tech and journalism communities.</p>
