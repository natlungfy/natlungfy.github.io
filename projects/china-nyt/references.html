		“China will be a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence,” said President Xi Jinping at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.</p>

		<p>In addition to military buildup and economic growth, he recognises soft power as an essential part of the effort.</p>

		<p>“We will improve our capacity for engaging in international communication so as to tell China’s stories well, present a true, multi-dimensional and panoramic view of China, and enhance our country’s cultural soft power,” Xi said.</p>

		<p>This goal of the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" is one shared by Chinese leaders since Mao Zedong, whose party narrative propogates that China had lost its supreme position in the world during the "century of humiliation" at the hands of foreign countries, particularly Japan and European empires.</p>

		<p>Have these efforts been successful? I set out to explore the changing perception of China through the lens of United States liberal mainstream media, as represented by the New York Times. In particular, word semanatics, or word usage, will be the metric in which we use to analyze perception.</p>

		<p>Nicknamed "The Gray Lady", The New York Times has been the second largest  circulated newspaper in the United States, and has been regarded a reputable news source for the liberal mainstream media.</p>

		<p>With a set of 6503 NYT articles that mention the word "China" from 1995-2017, I hope to explore the changing semantics of the word to understand more about:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>China's allies in the eyes of U.S. liberal mainstream media, as represented by the NYT</li>
			<li>China's role and involvement in international arena and diplomacy</li>
		</ol>
