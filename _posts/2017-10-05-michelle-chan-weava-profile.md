Like on most nights, Michelle Chan was silent, poking away at her favourite deep-fried milk at the dim sum joint she and schoolmate Andy Lai frequented after long hours of work for their startup. Still recovering from information overload and light alcohol from a prior meeting with a heavy-weight investor at a country club, which unexpectedly lasted for three hours, the two 2016 graduates of the University of Hong Kong were lost in their own thoughts. Lai would pose a question about some user reviews he saw in the company email, to which Chan quickly answered and got back to her meal. They both couldn't wait to go back to their homes and have a good night's sleep.

But on this September evening, an unusual energy was in the air. Accompanied by her three colleagues who were all suited up, Chan was walking, with a slight spring in her step, on the elevated bridge over Queensway, Admiralty as the Bank of China Tower glistened in the distance.

She had just met with the South China Morning Post's new CEO, Gary Liu, a serial technology executive whose work and business values she respected deeply and was eager to seek his mentorship for her company. 

With the help of a well-connected mentor, she pitched her startup to Liu.

The product was an online tool that organizes user highlights from websites and PDFs. It was first known as “Writio”, then “GistNote”. Finally, the team settled on “Weava”, which they hope would help students weave together information for research, saving them time from what Chan calls "grunt work" — opening multiple browser tabs and copying and pasting text into a reference document, only to realize later that you could not find what you need because that document has become 100 pages long. 

Liu loved the idea, and even offered to help her practise her business pitch. Chan was elated.

Until two years ago, Chan was still a third-year student studying International Business and Global Management and Computer Science at the University. She had just returned to Hong Kong from a year-long exchange at Yale and an internship at a San Francisco startup. Empowered by entrepreneurial culture in the States, she decided to pursue a startup idea she and Lai had while writing academic papers—all the while juggling seven courses and planning a technical final year project to graduate on time.
By the time they launched Weava into the world in October 2016, Chan had returned from a second pilgrimage in the States—a coveted design internship at Amazon's Seattle headquarters—and had made a decision that would have been daunting to most would-be graduates at HKU: giving up the full-time position Amazon had offered to pursue her dream full-time.

The journey of entrepreneurship is not a common course university graduates in Hong Kong steer. In 2015 HKU graduate employment surveys on Chan's business and computer science programs, while around 88 percent of 53 respondents were employed in full-time commerce and industry positions, only one graduate stated they were a co-founder of a company.

For many entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, the risk-averse city is a desert for innovation due to high property prices, lack of technical talent, and government's conservative approach to promoting innovation and technology. Many developers who could afford to move seek higher-paying jobs elsewhere, including Silicon Valley.
But the phrase "Silicon Valley isn't a place, it's a state of mind" resonated well with Chan, a Hong Kong-native who, like many others her age, is a product of the local education system. A self-proclaimed optimist, she crunched the numbers and estimated that her startup could stay in business for six to nine months with $50,000 in Hong Kong, but only three to six months with the same amount in San Francisco.

"San Francisco has more resources and talents, Hong Kong has lower costs. You should get the best of both sides if possible,” she said.
“But don’t complain because you’re not in San Francisco, because you’re a girl, because Hong Kong sucks… Just get what you can from everywhere. There’s good in everywhere and in every person.”

An argument against that phrase is often the high volume of interactions between investors, businessmen, and technologists that simply could not be replicated elsewhere, to which Chan said she owes her startup's growth. "It really comes down to the people you meet at the beginning of your journey," she said. 
In fact, it was during her time in San Francisco that she was put in touch with Thomas Pun, a former Apple, Inc manager who now advises startups full-time in Hong Kong, including Michelle’s venture. He was also the one who put her in contact with Gary Liu. 

"Without him, we will not be who we are today," said Chan, adding that Pun had taught her to "aim big" while still prioritising her startup's needs. In 2016, she passed up the invite to join AngelHack, an accelerator program in San Francisco, after coming first in the Hong Kong chapter with an early version of Weava, as she felt it was a "distraction".

In the months before heading to Seattle for Amazon, she met up with friends, schoolmates, and startup advisors in Hong Kong at perhaps the most cliche of places in startup culture—a coffee shop—and demoed a prototype of the tool on her Macbook Pro, which was covered in the Twitter and hackathon stickers she had collected in the States. 

It was during this time that she met her schoolmates— Lai, Anthony Chiu, and George Leung—who became the colleagues whom she spent more time with than her parents in subsequent months. "We hacked ourselves a free co-working space at school — by writing a program that books the same room every day using seven of our friends’ accounts, since each student had a booking quota of 2 hours," she said. "Every day we worked on Weava and do our homework together. 10am to midnight—even on weekends."

It was a similar scene every day in Room 11, the room they booked in HKU’s Chi Wah Learning Commons: Lai typing furiously on his laptop, followed by a loud thump on the table, then a triumphant "yes". Lai had crushed a bug in their JavaScript code, a language they grew to love and hate. "I have figured it out," he told Chan, as he continued scribbling his thought process in a flowchart on the white board behind him. Chan looked up from her laptop with a reassuring nod.
The team's momentum grew albeit with Chan in Seattle and Lai working as a Credit Suisse intern in Hong Kong in the summer of 2016. "I rushed back home at 5PM to work on Weava till past midnight and Skyped with Lai every day," she recalled.

The hard work during summer paid off. With everyone in Hong Kong in October 2016, her team launched the tool into a global market of over 48,000 Google Chrome browser plug-ins. Much to the team's surprise, their tool was featured on the homepage of the Chrome App Store hours later. 

One year on, Weava now has 4,000 monthly active users, and 30 percent of all users are from the United States, many of which are K-12 and Ivy League students and educators.

When Chan learnt that she could meet with Gary Liu, Pun said she got “really excited”. She had been looking forward to his advice when her team found themselves at a critical junction—they had to make a decision that would change their product’s target market. “Liu was the right person for [Chan] to talk to. He had been there before,” said Pun.

Despite the fatigue from replying emails and back-to-back meetings in the day, Chan left the meeting in Admiralty with a slight spring in her step. As a recently turned full-time entrepreneur and a paying employer of three, she was uncertain of the future, but also as determined as she could ever be. "Time is always a startup's enemy,” she said. “But in the coming few years, we are going to build a productivity tool that everyone will use."
